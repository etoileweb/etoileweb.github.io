The premium version of the Ultimate Reviews plugin comes with the ability to integrate with WooCommerce, that is to replace the basic reviews found in WooCommerce with the advanced review system from the Ultimate Reviews plugin.

You have options to replace both the reviews tab (so the review display and submit form) as well as the rating score and stars (where applicable/if your theme has them) with those from our plugin.

For more info about setting this up, please see:
