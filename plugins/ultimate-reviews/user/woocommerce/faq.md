## The stars do not show up on my shop page and/or product page

In order for the star rating to show on either the WooCommerce shop page or product page, your theme must support the WooCommerce rating stars to begin with. Our plugin does not create or add the star graphic itself. It replaces the calculated score used by the star graphic. If your theme doesn't already display the star graphic with WooCommerce's built-in reviews, it will not display it with our reviews.
