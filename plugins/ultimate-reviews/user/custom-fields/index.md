In-Depth Reviews are a feature of {{ page.plugin_title }} that let you add extra fields to your reviews, which can be included in the submit review form and also in the display of your reviews.

You can create additional review fields - such as value, appearance, quality, etc. - each with its own score/rating, which will be averaged to make an overall score for the review. You can also add fields to the review that don't affect the score/rating, such as text, checkbox, radio button and dropsdown fields.

For more info on in-depth reviews and adding extra fields, please see the following:
