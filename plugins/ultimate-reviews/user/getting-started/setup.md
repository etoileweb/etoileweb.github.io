When you first activate the plugin, it will automatically run a walk-through that will help you add pages to accept and display reviews, create review categories and set a few key options.

The walk-through consists of four steps.

1. **Submit Review Page**: This will create a new page on your WordPress site and place the submit review form on it.

2. **Display Reviews Page**: This will create a new page on your WordPress site to display your reviews.

3. **Set Key Options**: Here you can configure a few of the main options in the plugin, such as the maximum review score, the score input type and review filtering options.

4. **Categories**: This lets you create one or more categories, which you can then assign your reviews to. 

If you'd like, you can re-run the walk-through at any time by going to the following URL in your WordPress admin:

`admin.php?page=ewd-urp-getting-started`

So, if, for example, your site domain is:

`https://www.my-site.com/`

Then, to restart the walk-through, you would go to: 

`https://www.my-site.com/admin.php?page=ewd-urp-getting-started`

You're now ready to learn more about [Reviews](../reviews) and the available [blocks and shortcodes](../blocks-shortcodes).
