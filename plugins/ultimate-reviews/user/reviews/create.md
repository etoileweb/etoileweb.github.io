Most reviews will likely be created via user submission on your site. However, you can also create and edit reviews manually in your WordPress admin. To do this, go to **Reviews > Add New**. You'll see the following page:

*The following explains how to create a new review. The process is the same for editing one.*

Start by giving the review post a title. Then use the body content area below the title to write out the main review text.

After this, you can use the **Review Details** section underneath to set which product the review is for, who the author of the review is, give the review an overall score (if [in-depth reviews](../custom-fields) is disabled) or scores for each category (if [in-depth reviews](../custom-fields) is enabled), and input values for existing [custom fields](../custom-fields).

On the right of the screen, you'll see a number of panels for adding information to the review. Here you can do the following:

- Assign the review to one or more categories.
- Set a featured image for the review.
- Set the URL Slug for the review. This will be the permalink used when you visit the individual review page. 

Once you click the **Publish** button at the top, your review will be published.
