![Screenshot of the Reviews tab](/img/{{ page.slug }}/urp-reviews-tab.png)

Here you will see an overview of all your reviews, including the title, author, published date, number of views, which product it's for, the score and the post ID. If you have many reviews, the list may be broken up into multiple pages. 

You can sort the reviews by title, date, number of views, product or score simply by clicking the column heading. You can also search for a review or filter the reviews using the date or product dropdown fields.

To edit a review, just click on its title. To [create a new review](create), click the **Add New** button at the top.

Be sure to [add a submit review form](submit-review-form) to your site and to also [display the reviews](display-reviews) on your site.
