The premium version of the plugin comes with a feature that lets you require admin approval before a submitted review is displayed on your site.

To enable this feature, go to **Settings > Premium**, scroll down to the **RESTRICTIONS** section and toggle on the **Require Admin Approval** option.

With that option enabled, the reviews area in the admin will now be divided into two pages.

The **Approved Reviews** page shows all reviews that are currently published on your site. 

The **Awaiting Approval** page shows all reviews that have been submitted, but not yet approved. With the **Require Admin Approval** option enabled, when a new review is submitted, the post is set to draft status. To approve a new review, go to the **Awaiting Approval** page, click on a review and then click the **Publish** button. The review will now be published and visible on your site, and will now show on the  **Approved Reviews** page in the plugin admin.
