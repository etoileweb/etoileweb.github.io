To add your reviews to a page, you can use either the included Gutenberg block or shortcode.

For the Gutenberg block, on the page edit screen, just click the + button to add a new block, search for **review** and add the **Display Reviews** block to the page. You will see options in the right sidebar that let you choose how many reviews you want to display, which product to display reviews for, as well as to include or exclude specific reviews or review categories.

You can also add the reviews to your page using the following shortcode:

`[ultimate-reviews]`

To use this shortcode on the page edit screen, just click the + button and add a new shortcode block to the page. Then write or paste in the above shortcode.
