In Ultimate Reviews, you can create categories, which you can then assign your reviews to. This is helpful for grouping similar reviews together (e.g. reviews received as part of a specific promotion, reviews received in-store, etc.).

If you go to the **Categories** page in the plugin admin, you'll see an overview of all your existing categories.

You can **sort** them by clicking on one of the headings in the table. You can also search for a category.

To **edit** a category, click its title.

On the left side, you can create a new category.
