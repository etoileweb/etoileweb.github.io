## GENERAL

If you would like to hide the numerical score display in your reviews (e.g. show it shows just the stars), you can toggle on the **Disable Score Display** setting.

Use the **Review Skin Style** setting to choose which icons you want to use for the ratings in your reviews. Available options are: *Simple Stars*, *Thumbs* (thumbs up icons), *Hearts*, *Simple Bar* (bar is always the same color), *Color Bar* (bar changes color depending on rating), *Small Circle Graph* and *Circle Graph with Score* (score shows in the middle of the circle graph).

**Review Group Separating Line** adds a horizontal line between products if you are grouping reviews by product.

Setting **In-Depth Review Categories Layout** to *Alternating Background Color* will give every second field a light background color, to add sepration.

The **"Read More" Style** setting lets you choose whether to use a link or button for the "read more" text.
