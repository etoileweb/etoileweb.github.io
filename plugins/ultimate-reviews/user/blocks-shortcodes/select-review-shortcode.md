The following shortcode lets you display an individual review:

`[select-review id="X"]`

Where “X” is the ID of the review post. You can find the ID of a review by going to the Reviews page and clicking on a review. The ID will show in your browser’s address bar. (It’s the same way you would find the ID of a regular post in WordPress.)
