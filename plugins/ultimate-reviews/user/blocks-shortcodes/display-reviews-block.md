The name of the Gutenberg block is **Display Reviews**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Ultimate Reviews**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **review** or **Display Reviews** and add that block to the page.

You will see several options in the right sidebar:

- **Number of Reviews**: Specify the number of reviews you would like to display.
- **Product Name**: Specify the name of the product for which you want to show reviews. If left blank, it will show reviews for all products.
- **Include Category**: Specify which categories you want to include. It will only display reviews from these categories. Takes a comma-separated list of category slugs. e.g.: *my-first-category,my-second-category*
- **Exclude Category**: Specify which categories you want to exclude. It will display all reviews except those from these categories. Takes a comma-separated list of category slugs. e.g.: *my-first-category,my-second-category*
- **Include Specific Review IDs**: Choose specific reviews to show. It will only display these reviews. Takes a comma-separated list of review IDs. e.g.: *123,223,323*
- **Exclude Specific Review IDs**: Choose specific reviews to not show. It will display all reviews except these. Takes a comma-separated list of review ID. e.g.: *123,223,323*

You can find the ID of a review by going to the Reviews page and clicking on a review. The ID will show in your browser’s address bar. (It’s the same way you would find the ID of a regular post in WordPress.)
