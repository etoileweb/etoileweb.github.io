The name of the Gutenberg block is **Submit Review**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Ultimate Reviews**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **review** or **Submit Review** and add that block to the page.

You will see two options in the right sidebar:

- **Product Name**: Specify the name of the product you want the review submission to be for. If left blank, it will allow the user to specify/choose which product they are leaving the review.
- **Redirect Page**: Specify the URL of the page you would like the user to be redirected to after they submit the form.
