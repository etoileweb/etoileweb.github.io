The premium version of this plugin comes with many styling options, which can be accessed by navigating to **Settings > Styling**.

For info on adding/using custom CSS, please see [here](css).

## CATALOG

The section lets you adjust the styling of elements on the catalog page.

Enabling the **Fixed Thumbnail Size** setting will make all thumbnails the same size, cropping images if necessaary. This will give your page a uniform and symmetrical look without you having to individually edit all of your images.

**Catalog Style** lets you choose whether you want to use the default catalog look or switch to the **Block** style, which has bold accents and borders, or the **Minimalist/Hover** style, which offers a clean look that fits seamlessly into any site design.

**Category Heading** lets you select whether you want to display them as just text (**Normal**), as text with a background bar (**Block**) or not at all.

Use **Thumbnail Number of Columns** to change how many thumbnails will appear in each row on your catalog page. This applies to larger screens, as the catalog is responsive and will automatically reduce the number of columns on smaller screens, regardless of what is selected in this setting.

The rest of this section consists of settings that let you change the colors and font sizes of the various elements on the catalog page.

## THUMBNAIL VIEW

This section includes settings that let you change the colors, font sizes, borders, padding and heights of the various elements in the thumbnail view on the catalog page.

## LIST VIEW

**Product Click Action** decides what happens when someone clicks on a product in the list view. It can either expand to show the full product info or take you straight to the product page.

The rest of this section consists of settings that let you change the colors, font sizes, borders and padding of the various elements in the list view on the catalog page.

## DETAIL VIEW

This section includes settings that let you change the colors, font sizes, borders and padding of the various elements in the detail view on the catalog page.

## SIDEBAR

With **Collapsible Sidebar** you can make it so that all of the options under a specific heading/title in the filtering sidebar collapse when that heading is clicked.

**Sidebar Title Hover Effect** lets you add an underline effect on hover to sidebar titles.

**Checkbox Style** lets you choose the design you want for any filter using a checkbox control type. **Default** uses the browser default for a checkbox type input. **Checkmark** is a stylized variation on this. **Minimalist** shows no checkbox at all. **Block** highlights the selection.

**Categories Control Type** lets you choose whether you want to use a checkbox, radio button or dropdown as the filter type for categories in the sidebar on the catalog page.

**Sub-Categories Control Type** lets you choose whether you want to use a checkbox, radio button or dropdown as the filter type for sub-categories in the sidebar on the catalog page.

**Tags Control Type** lets you choose whether you want to use a checkbox, radio button or dropdown as the filter type for tags in the sidebar on the catalog page.

Use the **Sidebar Items Order** table to drag and drop the different sidebar elements into the order in which you want them to appear on the catalog page.

The rest of this section consists of settings that let you change the colors, font sizes and font weights of the various elements in the sidebar on the catalog page.

## PRODUCT PAGE

This section includes settings that let you change the colors, font size and font weight for the breadcrumbs on the product page.

## PAGINATION

This section includes settings that let you change the colors for the pagination controls on the catalog page.
