This plugin comes with a few options that you can use to assist you with the SEO of your catalog and products. These can be found on the **Settings > SEO** page.

- **Pretty Permalinks**: Enable this to display SEO-friendly pretty permalinks for the product page URLs. Whatever you fill in for the slug on the product edit screen will now be the permalink for the product page.
- **Permalink Base**: Set the permalink base for your product pages, if you would like it to be something other than *products*.
- **Permalink Base (Post Type)**: Set the slug of the product post type, if you would like it to be something other than the default *upcp_product*.
- **SEO By Yoast Integration**: Enabling this makes it so that Yoast will use the product title as the page meta title for the product page.
- **SEO Title**: Use this to set which elements you want to be included in the product page meta title. Available options are: `[product-name]`, `[category-name]` and `[subcategory-name]`
