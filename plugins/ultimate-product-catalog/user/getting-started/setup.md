When you first activate the plugin, it will automatically run a walk-through that will help you create your first product(s) and first catalog, and then add that catalog to a page.

The walk-through consists of four steps.

1. **Categories**: This lets you create one or more categories, which you can then assign your products to. 

2. **Add an Ultimate Product Catalog Page**: This will create a new page on WordPress site and place your catalog on it.

3. **Set Key Options**: Here you can configure a few of the main options in the plugin, such as the currency symbol, catalog color and the product search feature.

4. **Create a Product**: This final step is where you can create your first product and assign it to one of the categories you created in step 1. You can create as many products as you want here.

If you'd like, you can re-run the walk-through at any time by going to the following URL in your WordPress admin:

`admin.php?page=ewd-upcp-getting-started`

So, if, for example, your site domain is:

`https://www.my-site.com/`

Then, to restart the walk-through, you would go to: 

`https://www.my-site.com/admin.php?page=ewd-upcp-getting-started`

You're now ready to learn more about [products](../products), [catalogs](../catalogs) and the available [block and shortcodes](../block-shortcodes).
