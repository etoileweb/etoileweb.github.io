If you are using either the Tabbed or Shop Style product page type, then you have the ability to create additional tabs.

To do this, go to the **Product Page** screen and use the **Additional Tabs** section to specify the name and content of the new tab that you want to create.

## Dynamic Content

Whatever you write in either the name or content area will appear on all product pages. 

However, it is also possible to add **dynamic** content that is specific to each product using **custom fields**. If you add the custom field slug as a shortcode, it will display the value for that product. 

So, for example, you could create a new tab that you use to include the corresponding PDF instruction manual for each product.

For more info on displaying custom field values via shortcode, see [here](../custom-fields/shortcodes).

Make sure to click the **Update Tabs** button when you're done to save your changes.
