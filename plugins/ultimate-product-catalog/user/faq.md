## <a name="starting-layout"></a>Can I change the default layout of the catalog?

## <a name="sort-order"></a>How do I sort the order of the products in my catalog?

The default order of the items in the catalog can be set directly on the catalog edit screen. For more info, see [here](catalogs/order). For the categories and products within specific categories, the order is modified in the **Categories** area of the admin. For more info, see [here](products/categories#order-of-categories-and-products-in-a-category).

## <a name="translate"></a>Can I translate my products and catalogs?

Yes, the plugin uses custom post types and all the strings/labels are localized in the code. For more information on plugin translation, please see [here](labelling/translating).

## <a name="wpml"></a>Is this compatible with WPML?

Yes, the plugin uses custom post types. As such, if you enable our post types in the WPML settings, you'll be able to create translations of your products (and categories, sub-categories, tags, etc.) and catalogs. As well, all the strings/labels are localized in the code. As such, they will be picked up by WPML's String Translation tool for easy direct translating. 

For more info on translating the plugin, please see [here](labelling/translating).

## <a name="custom-fields"></a>Can I add extra fields to my products?

Yes, the premium version of the plugin includes the powerful custom fields feature, which lets you add extra fields to your products and also use them for filtering. For more info, see [here](custom-fields).

## <a name="custom-fields-not-displaying"></a>My custom fields are not displaying

Go to **Settings > Basic** and, for the **Extra Elements** option, make sure you have **Custom Fields** selected.
