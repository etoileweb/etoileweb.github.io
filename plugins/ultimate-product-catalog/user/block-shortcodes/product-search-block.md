The plugin comes with a Gutenberg block to add a product search field to any page on your site (other than the catalog page). The name of the block is **Product Search**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Ultimate Product Catalog**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **product search** and add the block to the page.

You will see several options in the right sidebar.

- **Catalog URL**: This attribute is required and makes it so that, when the search is submitted, the visitor is correctly redirected to the catalog page. Input the URL of the page on which you have placed the **Display Product Catalog** block or the **product-catalog** shortcode.
- **Search Label**: Lets you specify the text of the label for the search field.
- **Search Placeholder**: Lets you specify the text of the placeholder in the search field.
- **Submit Label**: Lets you specify the text of the submit button.
