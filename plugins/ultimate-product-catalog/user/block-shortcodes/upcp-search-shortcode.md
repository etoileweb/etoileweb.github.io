The plugin comes with a shortcode to add a product search field to any page on your site (other than the catalog page). The shortcode is:

`[upcp-search catalogue_url="https://www.your-site.com/catalog-page/"]`

## Attributes

The upcp-recent-products shortcode takes the following attributes:

`catalogue_url` This attribute is required and makes it so that, when the search is submitted, the visitor is correctly redirected to the catalog page. Input the URL of the page on which you have placed the **Display Product Catalog** block or the **product-catalog** shortcode.

`search_label` Lets you specify the text of the label for the search field.

`search_placeholder` Lets you specify the text of the placeholder in the search field.

`submit_label` Lets you specify the text of the submit button.
