The plugin comes with a Gutenberg block to display random products on any page on your site (other than the catalog page). The name of the block is **Random Products**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Ultimate Product Catalog**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **random products** and add the block to the page.

You will see several options in the right sidebar.

- **Which Catalog**: Use this dropdown to select which catalog you want to display products from.
- **Catalog URL**: This attribute is required and makes it so that, when someone clicks on a product, they are correctly brought to the product page. Input the URL of the page on which you have placed the Display Product Catalog block or the product-catalog shortcode.
- **Number of Products**: This attribute is used to set the number of products you want to show.
