Here you will see an overview of all your products, including the description, price, categories, sub-categories and number of views for each. If you have many products, the list may be broken up into multiple pages. 

You can sort the products by title, date, price or number of views simply by clicking the column heading. You can also search for a product or filter the products using the date dropdown field.

To edit a product, just click on its title. To [create a new product](create), click the **Add New** button at the top.
