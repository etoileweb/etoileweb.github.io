If you are using the premium version of the plugin, then you can export all of your products to a spreadsheet. To do this, just go to the **Export** page in the plugin admin and click the **Export to Spreadsheet** button. The file will be downloaded as a .CSV, which can be opened in any spreadsheet program.
