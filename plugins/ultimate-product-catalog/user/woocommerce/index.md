The premium version of the Ultimate Product Catalog plugin comes with the ability to sync your products with WooCommerce. This allows you to use the catalog as your main shop page while also using WooCommerce's checkout features, giving you the best of both worlds. 

You get a catalog with advanced filtering, so people can quickly find exactly what they're looking for, and then the safe cart and checkout features that you already know and trust.
