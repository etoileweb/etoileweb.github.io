title: Custom Fields and Filtering

If, when [creating your custom field](create), you checked the **Searchable** option, then that custom field will now display in the filtering sidebar on your catalog page and, using the control type you set for the **Filtering Control Type** option, people will be able to select a value and the catalog will automatically filter itself to show only products with that value.

**Note**: If there are no products in a catalog that have a value assigned to them for a particular custom field, that field will not show in the filtering sidebar, regardless of whether or not the **Searchable** option is checked.
