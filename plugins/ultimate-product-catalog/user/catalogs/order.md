There are two ways to order the items in your catalog. To manually set the order, you can drag and drop the items.

You can also sort the catalog items alphabetically or reverse alphabetically using the two buttons below the ADD button.

## Ordering Products within a Category

If you are adding a whole category to the catalog and want to sort the items within that specific category, you can [do so from the Categories page](../products/categories#order-of-categories-and-products-in-a-category).
