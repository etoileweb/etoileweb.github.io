To create or edit locations, which you can then assign to orders, go to the **Locations** area of the Settings page. Here you will see a table with all your existing locations as well as a button to add a new one.

The process is the same to add or edit a location. You need to fill in the following for each:

- **Name**: The name you want to give to your location.
- **Latitude**: Input the coordinates of the latitude of your location (e.g. 34.090670). This will allow it to show on the tracking map, if you're using that feature.
- **Longitude**: Input the coordinates of the latitude of your location (e.g. -118.327278). This will allow it to show on the tracking map, if you're using that feature.

When you're done creating/editing your locations, make sure to click the **Save Changes** button to save your changes.

To set the location for an order, go to the order edit screen and use the **Location** dropdown to select which you want. For more info, see [here](create).
