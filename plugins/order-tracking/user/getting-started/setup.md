When you first activate the plugin, it will automatically run a walk-through that will help you create your first product(s) and first catalog, and then add that catalog to a page.

The walk-through consists of four steps.

1. **Statuses**: This lets you create new custom statuses, which you can then assign to your orders. 

2. **Add an Order Tracking Page**: This will create a new page on your WordPress site and place your tracking form on it.

4. **Set Key Options**: Here you can configure a few of the main options in the plugin, such as which information to display when tracking an order, when to send notification emails, the tracking form instructions and whether or not to hide blank fields.

3. **Create an Order**: Here is where you can create your first order. You can enter the name, order number, associated email address and the status you want to assign to that order. You can create as many ordres as you would like here.

If you'd like, you can re-run the walk-through at any time by going to the following URL in your WordPress admin:

`admin.php?page=ewd-otp-getting-started`

So, if, for example, your site domain is:

`https://www.my-site.com/`

Then, to restart the walk-through, you would go to: 

`https://www.my-site.com/admin.php?page=ewd-otp-getting-started`

You're now ready to learn more about [Orders](../orders) and the available [blocks and shortcodes](../blocks-shortcodes).
