## <a name="shortcode"></a>Is there a shortcode to display the order tracking form?

Yes, you can use the `[tracking-form]` shortcode. For more info, see [here](blocks-shortcodes/tracking-form-shortcode).

## <a name="block"></a>Is there a Gutenberg block to display the order tracking form?

Yes, you can search for the **Tracking Form** block. Alternatively, you'll find it in its own block category/section called **Order Tracking**. For more info, see [here](blocks-shortcodes/tracking-form-block).

## <a name="google-map"></a>How do I add a map to the tracking page?

You first need to make sure the **Tracking Map** choice is selected for the **Order Information Displayed** option in the Basic area of the Settings page. Then you need to provide your Google Maps API key in the designated area, also in the Basic area of the Settings page. 

Then you need to make sure you have provided latitude and longitude coordinates for your locations.

After this, when you set an order to a specific location, that location will show on a map on the tracking results page.

## <a name="sales-reps"></a>Can Sales Reps manage and create their own orders?

Yes. You just need to associate the sales rep with an existing WordPress user account and then they will have access to their own customized dashboard in the WordPress admin. For more info, please see [here](sales-reps/wordpress-user).

## <a name="customer"></a>Is it possible for my customer to view their orders without entering the ID?

Yes. You just need to associate the customer with an existing WordPress user account. Then, when they log in and go to the page with the customer tracking form on it, they will automatically see all of their orders. For more info, please see [here](customers/wordpress-user).

## <a name="wpml"></a>Is this compatible with WPML?

Yes. All the strings/labels are localized in the code. As such, they will be picked up by WPML's String Translation tool for easy direct translating. 

For more info on translating the plugin, please see [here](labelling/translating).

## <a name="custom-fields"></a>Can I add extra fields to my orders?

Yes, the premium version of the plugin includes the **Custom Fields** feature, which lets you add extra fields to your orders and to the customer order form. For more info, see [here](custom-fields).
