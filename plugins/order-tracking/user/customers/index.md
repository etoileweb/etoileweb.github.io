If you are using the premium version of the plugin, then you can create customers and assign orders to them. You can then add a customer tracking form to your site, so your customers can see all of their orders on one page.

- [Create a Customer](create)
- [Customer Tracking Form](tracking-form)
- [Associate Customer with WordPress User](wordpress-user)
- [Customer Order Form](customer-order-form)
