The **Customer Form** Gutenberg block adds a customer tracking form to your page. With this, the customer can enter their ID and see a table with all of their orders. Or, if they are logged in with the associated WordPress account, the table will automatically show on the page without the need to enter their ID. For more info about customers, please see [here](../customers). 

The block can be found in its own category/section called **Order Tracking**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **customer** or **Customer Form** and add that block to the page.
