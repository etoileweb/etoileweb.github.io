If you're using the premium version, then you can add the **Customer Order Form** Gutenberg block to a page. This places an order form on your page that your customer can fill out to submit/create their own order, which you can then update (status, etc.) in the admin. For more info about the customer order form, please see [here](../customers/customer-order-form).

The block can be found in its own category/section called **Order Tracking**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **customer** or **Customer Order Form** and add that block to the page.
