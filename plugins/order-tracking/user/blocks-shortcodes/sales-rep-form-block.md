title: Sales Rep Form Block
---
The **Sales Rep Form** Gutenberg block adds a sales rep tracking form to your page. With this, the sales rep can enter their ID and see a table with all of their orders. Or, if they are logged in with the associated WordPress account, the table will automatically show on the page without the need to enter their ID. For more info about sales reps, please see [here](../sales-reps).

The block can be found in its own category/section called **Order Tracking**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **sales rep** or **Sales Rep Form** and add that block to the page.
