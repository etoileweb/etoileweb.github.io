The name of the Gutenberg block is **Tracking Form**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Order Tracking**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **tracking** or **Tracking Form** and add that block to the page.

You will see the following option in the right sidebar:

- **Show Orders?**: This lets you choose whether or not you want to show all orders. Choosing **Yes** will display all orders in a list, instead of the input to enter and search for an order number.
