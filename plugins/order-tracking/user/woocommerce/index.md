The premium version of the Order Tracking plugin comes with the ability to integrate with WooCommerce. With this enabled, every time someone places an order via WooCommerce on your site, a corresponding order will automatically be created in our plugin.

The goal of this feature is to let you manage all of the status updating and tracking for that order directly in our plugin, instead of WooCommerce, giving you a one-stop shop for all your tracking work while giving your customers the enhanced tracking experience offered by our plugin (including the tracking map, custom fields, etc.).

To enable this feature, just go to **Settings > WooCommerce** and toggle on the **WooCommerce Integration** option.
