## I created a new order in WooCommerce, but it is not showing up in this plugin.

A corresponding order is automatically created in this plugin only for orders that are placed via WooCommerce checkout on (the front end of) your website. Any orders manually created in the WooCommerce admin are not automatically added to this plugin.

## Is it possible to make the automatically-created order in this plugin have the exact same order number as in WooCommerce?

Yes, this is definitely possible. To do this, just make sure to leave the **WooCommerce Prefix** option blank and to toggle on the **Disable WooCommerce Random Suffix** option, both found in the [WooCommerce integration settings](settings).

## Will this automatically sync/add past WooCommerce orders?

It will not. Only new orders placed via WooCommerce checkout on (the front end of) your website while our plugin is activated will be be automatically added/created.
