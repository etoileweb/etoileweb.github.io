Custom fields are a feature of the [premium version](../premium) of {{ page.plugin_title }} that let you add extra fields to your FAQs, which can be displayed on your main FAQ page, on individual FAQ pages and on the search page.

The custom fields are very versatile and can be used in many different ways. For example, you can create a field to add an extra level of classification to your FAQs (beyond categories and tags), to upload a PDF instruction manual or any other type of file, to add a link to an FAQ, to add a date stamp to an FAQ, etc. The possible uses are endless.
