## On the search page, can I show all my FAQs on page load?

Yes, definitely. If you're using the Gutenberg block, just make sure to set the **Show all FAQs on Page Load** option to **Yes**. For more info on this, please see [here](../blocks-shortcodes/search-faqs-block). If you're using the shortcode, then you can add the `show_on_load="Yes"` attribute. More info about this can be found [here](../blocks-shortcodes/ultimate-faq-search-shortcode).

## Is there an auto-complete option for the search bar?

Yes, there is. To enable it, go to **Settings > Premium** and toggle on the **FAQ Auto Complete Titles** option.
