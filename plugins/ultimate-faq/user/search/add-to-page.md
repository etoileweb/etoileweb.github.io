To add the FAQ search form to a page, you can use either the included Gutenberg block or shortcode.

For the Gutenberg block, on the page edit screen, just click the + button to add a new block and add the **Search FAQs** block to the page. You will see options in the right sidebar that let you show all FAQs on page load and to include or exclude certain categories.

[More information about the block](../blocks-shortcodes/search-faqs-block).

You can also add the search form to your page using the following shortcode:

`[ultimate-faq-search]`

To use this shortcode on the page edit screen, just click the + button and add a new shortcode block to the page. Then write or paste in the above shortcode.

You can view more information and all the available shortcode attributes [here](../blocks-shortcodes/ultimate-faq-search-shortcode).
