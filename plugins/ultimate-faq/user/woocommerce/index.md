The premium version of the Ultimate FAQ plugin comes with the ability to add FAQs to WooCommerce products. Our plugin adds a new tab to your WooCommerce product page, which lists all the applicable FAQs. To enable this, just go to **Settings > Premium** and toggle on the **WooCommerce FAQs** option.

The **Use WooCommerce Product Object** option makes it so that the FAQ tab is set up using the WooCommerce product object, as in the WC documentation, instead of just using the ID of the page.
