To set the order of your FAQs, go to **Settings > Ordering**.

For your FAQs, you can choose to sort them by:

- Created Date
- Title
- Modified Date

And then you can choose whether to make your selection go in ascending or descending order.

If you're grouping your FAQs by category, then you can choose to sort the categories by:

- Name
- FAQ Count
- Slug

And then, for this as well, you can choose whether to make your selection go in ascending or descending order.

If you are using the [premium version](../premium), then you have the option to choose **Selected Order** for the **FAQ Ordering** setting. This will add a new page in the plugin admin (called **FAQ Order**), on which you you will find a drag and drop table that you can use to choose the exact order you want for your FAQs.
