If you are using the premium version of the plugin, then you can export all of your FAQs to a spreadsheet or to a PDF file. To do this, just go to the **Export** page in the plugin admin.

If you click the **Export to Spreadsheet** button, the file will be downloaded as a .CSV, which can be opened in any spreadsheet program.

Clicking the **Export to PDF** button will generate a neatly laid out PDF file, which is handy for creating things like a knowledgebase or if you would like to print out a help document.
