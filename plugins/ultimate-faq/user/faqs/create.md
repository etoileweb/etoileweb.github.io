Start by giving the FAQ post a title. This will be the question. Then use the body content area below the title to write out the answer for the FAQ.

After this, you can use the **FAQ Details** section underneath to set the author display name.

On the right of the screen, you'll see a number of panels for adding information to your FAQ. Here you can do the following:

- Assign the FAQ to one or more categories
- Addign the FAQ one or more tags
- Set the URL Slug for your FAQ. This will be the permalink used when you visit the individual FAQ page. 

Once you click the **Publish** button at the top, your FAQ will be published.
