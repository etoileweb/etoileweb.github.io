To add your FAQs to a page, you can use either the included Gutenberg block or shortcode.

For the Gutenberg block, on the page edit screen, just click the + button to add a new block, search for **faq** and add the **Display FAQs** block to the page. You will see options in the right sidebar that let you choose how many FAQs you want to display, as well as to include or exclude certain categories.

You can also add the FAQs to your page using the following shortcode:

`[ultimate-faqs]`

To use this shortcode on the page edit screen, just click the + button and add a new shortcode block to the page. Then write or paste in the above shortcode.
