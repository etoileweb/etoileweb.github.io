title: Create FAQs using AI
---
You can create FAQs using AI (via our Open AI integration). To do this, go to the **FAQs** screen in the plugin admin. There, at the top, beside the **Add New** button, you will see an **AI Assist** button. Click this to open the modal where you will be able to generate new FAQs.

Here there are three fields you need to configure:

- **Number of FAQs**: Use this to choose the number of FAQs you want the plugin to automatically generate using AI. *The free version is limited to one FAQ. With the premium version, you can create up to 20 at a time.*
- **Page Content to Condense**: Choose which posts and/or pages you want to pull content from to generate the FAQs. *In the free version, you can only choose one page or post. With the premium version, you can select as many as you want (Control-click on PC or Command-click on Mac to select multiple).*
- **Sort into Categories**: Set this to **Yes** if you want the plugin to automatically assign the AI-generated FAQs into categories.

When you are ready, click the **Create** button. The generation process may take a few minutes. When it is complete, it will display all of the generated FAQs, so you can review them and modify them if need be. When you are satisfied with the output, you can click the **Publish** button to instantly publish the FAQs.

***Privacy note**: The plugin sends the selected post or page content to our server, which is forwarded to Open AI when using the AI FAQ generation feature. No other data is sent to external sources.*
