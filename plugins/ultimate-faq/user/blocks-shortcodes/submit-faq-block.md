If you are using the premium version, then you can add a form that lets people submit their own FAQ via our included Gutenberg block. The name of the block is **Submit FAQ**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Ultimate FAQ**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **faq** or **Submit FAQ** and add that block to the page.
