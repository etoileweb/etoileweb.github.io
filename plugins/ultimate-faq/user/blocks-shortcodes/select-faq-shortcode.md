The following shortcode lets you display an individual FAQ:

`[select-faq id="X"]`

Where “X” is the ID of the FAQ post. You can find the ID by going to the **FAQs** page and clicking on an FAQ. The ID will show in your browser's address bar. (It's the same way you would find the ID of a regular post in WordPress.)
