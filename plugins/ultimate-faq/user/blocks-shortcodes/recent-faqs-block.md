The plugin comes with a Gutenberg block to display the most recently-created FAQs. The name of the block is **Recent FAQs**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Ultimate FAQ**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **faq** or **Recent FAQs** and add that block to the page.

You will see the following options in the right sidebar:

- **Number of FAQs**: Specify the number of FAQs you would like to display.
