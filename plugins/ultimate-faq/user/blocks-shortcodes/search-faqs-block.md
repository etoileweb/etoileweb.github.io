If you are using the premium version, then you can add an FAQ search form to your page via our included Gutenberg block. The name of the block is **Search FAQs**. It can be found in its own category/section called **Ultimate FAQ**. Alternatively, when you add a new block, you can just search for **faq** or **Search FAQs** and add that block to the page.

You will see several options in the right sidebar:

- **Include Category**: Specify which categories you want to include. It will only display FAQs from these categories. Takes a comma-separated list of category slugs. e.g.: *my-first-category,my-second-category*
- **Exclude Category**: Specify which categories you want to exclude. It will display all FAQs except those from these categories. Takes a comma-separated list of category slugs. e.g.: *my-first-category,my-second-category*
- **Show all FAQs on Page Load?**: Typing in **Yes** will make it so that your FAQs display on page load. Otherwise only the search field will display.
